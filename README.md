# Vehicle Analysis with Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing vehicle data using machine learning techniques. The aim of this project is to predict various attributes or behaviors related to vehicles based on input data. This README file serves as a guide to understand the structure of the repository, how to use the code, and the purpose of each component.

## Contents
1. **Data**: This directory contains datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models. It may also include scripts for data preprocessing.
2. **Models**: Here reside the trained machine learning models. Each model may have its own directory along with any necessary files.
3. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the analysis and model training process. These notebooks provide a step-by-step guide and explanations of the code.
4. **Scripts**: Additional scripts for various purposes, such as evaluation metrics calculation, model deployment, etc.
5. **Documentation**: Documentation related to the project, including this README file and any additional guides.
